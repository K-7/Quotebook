# Quotebook
A private Quotebook web application I created so my friends and I can share quotes for fun. The application uses Amazon Web Services for DynamoDB (non-relational database) and Linux virtual machine hosting. Server-side scripting is handled by my Python-Flask server and Front-end uses the Bootstrap framework.
